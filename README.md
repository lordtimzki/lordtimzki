### Hi! My name is Tim and I'm an aspiring iOS/Web developer studying Computer Science at UC Irvine.  
<a>What got me interested into Mobile/Web Development was the amount of things you can do on an phone and the beautiful visuals that you can provide with websites. As of right now, I am currently working on my portfolio website. Check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-dacalos-63149b1b7/)! </a>
